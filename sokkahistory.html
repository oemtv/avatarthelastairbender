        <p>Sokka was born in the South Pole region to Chief Hakoda and Kya in 84 AG. Growing up as part of a minor tribe that lived in Wolf Cove, the remains of the Southern Water Tribe's ruined capital, Sokka was raised from a young age to be a warrior and possessed much knowledge of Water Tribe weapons and tactics. When he was ten, Sokka witnessed one of the last major Fire Nation raids on his tribe, during which his mother was targeted and killed, leaving him with great hatred for the Fire Nation.</p>
        <p>When his father left with the other men of the tribe to fight in the Hundred Year War, Sokka was put under his Gran Gran's care and became his tribe's last defense. He took the task seriously, building a number of snow watchtowers around the village and even "training" the young children of Wolf Cove as soldiers. Although Sokka had the spirit of a warrior and the courage to stand up to any enemy, he initially lacked the skills and techniques that would make him a formidable opponent. That would not stop him from trying, though, especially if his friends needed help. He was protective of his younger sister and treasured the boomerang[18] given to him by his father.</p>
        <p>During his travels with Aang, Sokka improved his skills significantly and evolved into a skilled fighter with a sword forged from meteorite metal. He became a true leader and a cunning strategic planner.</p>
        <p>While on a fishing expedition for their village of Wolf Cove, Sokka and his younger sister Katara accidentally steered their canoe into a rip current, where it was crushed between ice floes. Subsequently, the duo found a mysterious figure trapped in a large spherical ice block. The figure introduced himself as Aang, an airbender, and offered to escort them home on his flying bison Appa. After Wolf Cove was attacked by soldiers on a Fire Nation ship commanded by Prince Zuko, Katara learned that Aang was the Avatar and eventually managed to persuade her brother to help him. She and her brother set out to save Aang, who had himself purposefully arrested to save the village. After their successful rescue, the three began their journey to the North Pole together with the intent of finding a waterbending master who would teach the Avatar and Katara the secrets of waterbending. During their journey to the Northern Water Tribe, the group stopped in several locations across the world, mostly in the war-torn Earth Kingdom. Their first stop was the Southern Archipelago, where they helped a local dojo before arriving at the Southern Air Temple, where Sokka and the rest of Team Avatar learned of the genocide of the Air Nomads. Next, the team stopped on Kyoshi Island, where Sokka met Suki, with whom he at first had a difficult relation because of his views on gender roles; however, Suki helped Sokka begin to challenge these notions. On Kyoshi Island, they were ambushed by the banished prince and barely managed to escape. After leaving Kyoshi Island, Aang, Katara, and Sokka journeyed to the great Earth Kingdom city of Omashu. On the way, they intervened in the siege of Shen Guan. Upon arriving at Omashu, they were brought before the elderly king of the city who treated them like royalty and threw them a feast before imprisoning them and held Sokka and Katara hostage. It was later revealed that this was none other than Bumi, a childhood friend of Aang.</p>
        <p>Before reaching the Northern Water Tribe, the trio encountered several other adventures, all the while being chased by both Zuko and his uncle Iroh, and Commander (later Admiral) Zhao of the Fire Navy. Among their missions, Sokka and Team Avatar helped the villagers of Senlin Village who were being attacked by a spirit called Hei Bai, where Sokka was taken to the Spirit World; barely escaped the clutches of Zhao and Prince Zuko, where Katara lost her mother's necklace; discovered the darker side of the resistance when they came into contact with Jet and his Freedom Fighters who tried to destroy the neighboring village of Gaipan and kill all the Fire Nation civilians living there before Sokka's intervention; helped two warring tribes, the Zhang and the Gan Jin, to cross the Great Divide and to reconcile; saved Makapu Village from the eruption of its volcano; reunited with his father's friend and fellow warrior Bato, with whom Sokka completed his ice dodging coming-of-age ritual; met Jeong Jeong, who unsuccessfully tried to teach Aang the powers of firebending; and met and saved the refugees who lived in the Northern Air Temple from a Fire Nation military force led by War Minister Qin, among them Teo and his father, the mechanist, with whom Sokka formed a deep bond due to their mutual interest in technology.</p>
        <p>After reaching the Northern Water Tribe, Team Avatar was greeted as honored guests by Chief Arnook at a banquet, where Sokka met Princess Yue and fell in love with her. Even though she reciprocated his affections, their romance was not possible, as Yue had already been betrothed to Hahn, with whom Sokka formed a deep-rooted rivalry. During the Siege of the North, Sokka proved vital in the defense of the city, instructing an elite group of Water Tribe warriors how to infiltrate the Fire Nation ships, even though he himself was not allowed to participate in the fight because Arnook instructed Sokka to stay back and protect Yue. Sokka later helped Katara and Yue search for Aang after he was abducted by Zuko. Their friend was eventually found and brought back to the Spirit Oasis with an unconscious Zuko, where he could return from the Spirit World, though they found that the Moon Spirit had been mortally wounded by Zhao. While Aang fused with La and attacked the Fire Nation armada, Yue sacrificed herself to give the koi fish the part of its life force that was inside her. She became the reincarnation of Tui, the Moon Spirit, and gave Sokka one final kiss as she faded away and restored the balance of the spirit.</p>

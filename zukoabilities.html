        <p>While growing up in the Fire Nation, Zuko showed no extraordinary skill in firebending. In his teen years, however, his ability began to develop significantly under his Uncle Iroh's tutelage, most noticeably during the last year of the Hundred Year War. He became able to fight on par with much more experienced firebenders, showing himself to be a late bloomer. Having continuously refined his skills, he has reached the point of becoming a firebending master, but despite his skill and fast development as a firebender, he has noted on more than one occasion that he is not as skilled or as powerful as his younger sister, Azula.</p>
        <p>As a child, Zuko could only create small bursts of flame and was by no means focused or controlled in his bending, but by the time he was thirteen, he was confident enough in his abilities to readily accept a challenge of Agni Kai against General Bujing.</p>
        <p>Around the time of Aang's discovery at the South Pole, Zuko was still learning the basics from Iroh yet was skilled enough to momentarily knock Aang off his ship, but he was defeated when Aang went into the Avatar State. He utilized what he had been taught to defeat Zhao, an older and more experienced master firebender. Throughout his pursuit of Aang, he demonstrated his skill often; he defeated multiple foes on two occasions. Later, his skill grew. He fared well in a duel against Aang, delivering multiple fire blasts for a sustained period without tiring, but was defeated when he was paralyzed by June's confused shirshu. He created a shield of fire to protect himself from a massive explosion on his ship. During the Siege of the North, he fought Katara while the moon was nearly full. He held his own against her while she was strengthened by the moon but needed the power of the sun to gain the upper hand and defeat her with one fire blast. He also landed a decisive victory in a rematch against Zhao.</p>
        <p>After the Siege of the North, Zuko's firebending became more advanced and powerful. At first, he was unable to land any blows against Azula and was defeated rather easily. He fought somewhat better during the Confrontation at Tu Zin; in a three-way battle with Azula and Aang, he exchanged several fire blasts with his sister and kept the Avatar on the defensive. As his travels in the Earth Kingdom continued, however, he learned more advanced firebending techniques from Iroh, such as lightning redirection, becoming more efficient and refined. During a battle with the Rough Rhinos, he sent a small bolt of fire through Vachir's bow, breaking the string. He demonstrated the ability to fire multiple small blasts through two fingers rather than his whole fist. During the battle in the Crystal Catacombs, he demonstrated how far his prowess had grown. His fire blasts were more powerful, and he charged his attacks before releasing them, creating devastating bodies of enourmous flame. He also demonstrated the ability to create two fire-whips capable of smashing through crystal pillars. He battled evenly with Aang, even though he had skillfully used airbending and earthbending. After switching opponents with Azula, he battled evenly with Katara, a waterbending master who had the upper hand against Azula.</p>
        <p>Little was seen of Zuko's firebending after he returned to the Fire Nation; however, he was confident enough in his abilities that he offered to teach Aang. He utilized a wall of flame to stop an attack from Combustion Man and was capable of dodging many of the rocks Toph hurled at him. Later, he temporarily lost his firebending from a subsequent lack of rage, the former source of his power. In order to reconnect with the original source of firebending, he and Aang traveled to the ancient city of the Sun Warriors together. There, Zuko learned "The Dancing Dragon", an ancient firebending form that he performed alongside Aang. Learning this form appeared to have influenced his style of firebending to be more fluid, creating a more dancelike form as opposed to the rigid, militaristic forms commonly used by Fire Nation soldiers. He was also challenged by the Tribesmen to carry a piece of the Eternal Flame all the way up to the cave of the masters. Zuko and Aang performed their newly learned technique in unison with the dragons, who engulfed them in a spiral of multi-colored flames. After viewing this, Zuko found a new source of power in reverence for fire's power as a source of life and energy: "the sun inside you". His stylistic differences and skill are demonstrated at the Boiling Rock, where he briefly battled against Azula alongside Sokka. During the fight, he deflected many of Azula's fire blasts with only his arms or his own fire and traded fireballs with her. When he faced Azula again, Zuko was able to duel her to a standstill, firing several large and powerful fire blasts and deflecting many of her attacks. Later, he attacked Aang with powerful fire blasts to make him fight back. When he chased him into Ozai's old family vacation home, Zuko created several lashes of fire to envelop his surroundings and augmented them to the shape of the hallway Aang was running through. Furthermore, he used his firebending in conjunction with his broadswords, demonstrated an ability to form fire daggers, and limited use of breath of fire.</p>
        <p>During his training with Iroh, Zuko attempted to learn how to create lightning. His inner turmoil, however, rendered him unable to achieve the required peace of mind, and his attempts to produce lightning would only explode in his face. Instead, Iroh taught him how to absorb and redirect lightning. He later employed this technique against his father and Azula to protect Katara. In the latter engagement, Zuko redirected the blast in an improper stance, as he had jumped into the lightning's path and thus failed to redirect it properly, resulting in serious injury. Though he seems to have overcome his inner turmoil, he does not create lightning for the remainder of the series.
            With the power of Sozin's Comet, Zuko's firebending was enhanced. In his Agni Kai with Azula during this time, he was able to match her powerful sheets of blue flame and even steadily gain the upper hand, not showing any visible strain in exchanging and blocking Azula's attacks while she was pushed toward exhaustion and increasing mental instability. He displayed several incredibly powerful techniques: blocking an enormous stream of fire with a short fire-blast, spreading to take the shape of a wall and split the stream, unleashing an enormous charged-blast, which Azula was unable to block, forcing her to dodge, propelling himself into the air, charging his fire and sending down a fire attack as he came. His final attack was a fire tornado he created with his feet while spinning, knocking Azula off her feet.</p>
